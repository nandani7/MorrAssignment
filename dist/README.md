## How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
For technical part, I have choosen React.<br/>
React is fast, scalable and simple. Hence, it was my ultimate choice. <br/>
It helped me to create my web application that can change data, without reloading the page.<br/>
<br/>
As per architectural part project's src folder contains App.js, index.js,CSS files and all the components used. Public folder contains index.html and assests.<br/>
All the files and folders are inside the dist folder.<br/>
I have used react-router and react dom in the project.<br/>
<br/>
## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
I have made the website responsive and dynamic. The website fetches the data from JSON file and show it in the pages.<br/>
I have also made a custom favicon for the project.
<br/>
## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
If I have had more time, I would have included the login page. Also, I would have add respective pages of each movie and series that would give their information.<br/>
