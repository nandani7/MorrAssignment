For technical part, I have choosen React.
React is fast, scalable and simple. Hence, it was my ultimate choice. 
It helped me to create my web application that can change data, without reloading the page.

As per architectural part project's src folder contains App.js, index.js,CSS files and all the components used. Public folder contains index.html and assests.
All the files and folders are inside the dist folder.
I have used react-router and react dom in the project.

I have made the website responsive and dynamic. The website fetches the data from JSON file and show it in the pages.

If I have had more time, I would have included the login page. Also, I would have add respective pages of each movie and series that would give their information.
